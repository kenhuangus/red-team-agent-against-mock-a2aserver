# Red Team A2A: AI-Driven Vulnerability Assessment for A2A Servers

## 1. What is this project?

Red Team A2A is a Next.js web application designed for AI-driven vulnerability assessment of Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication servers. It employs generative AI (leveraging Genkit and Gemini models) to simulate various red teaming attack scenarios against a target A2A server. The primary goal is to automatically formulate varied and challenging prompts that identify potential vulnerabilities.

The application features:
- An AI-powered red teaming engine that tests for various threat categories.
- An embedded mock A2A server that simulates a vulnerable backend, allowing the red teaming AI to perform live HTTP interactions.
- An interactive dashboard to configure tests, view vulnerability reports, and inspect interaction logs.

### Core Components

- **Next.js App:** The primary web application that serves the frontend and backend API routes.
    - **Dashboard UI (`/`):** The main user interface built with React, Next.js App Router, and ShadCN UI components. It allows users to configure and run tests.
    - **AI Red Team Flows (`/src/ai/flows`):** A collection of Genkit flows, each designed to test a specific threat category (e.g., Authorization, Hallucination). These flows use prompts and tools to interact with both the Gemini models and the target A2A server.
    - **Embedded Mock A2A Server (`/api/mock-a2a/...`):** A set of Next.js API routes that simulate a multi-agent insurance claim processing system. This server is intentionally designed with potential vulnerabilities for the AI to discover and exploit.

- **Genkit & Gemini:** The core of the AI engine. Genkit orchestrates the AI flows, manages tools (like an HTTP client), and interacts with Google's Gemini models to generate analysis, reports, and attack simulations.

## 3. How to Run

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Setup:
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/red-team-a2a.git
    cd red-team-a2a
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    - Add your Google AI API Key:
      ```env
      GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"
      ```
    - The application is configured to run on `http://localhost:9002`. This is set as `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and is used by the mock server's discovery mechanism. If you need to change the port, update this variable accordingly:
      ```env
      NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:9002
      ```

### Running the Application:
For development, you need to run both the Next.js server and the Genkit development UI.

1.  **Start the Next.js Development Server:**
    (This serves the UI and the embedded mock A2A server)
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit Development Server:**
    (Recommended for debugging AI flows)
    In a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    The Genkit Dev UI will be available at `http://localhost:4000`. This UI lets you inspect flow traces, inputs, outputs, and any errors from the AI flows.

### Using the Application:
1.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:9002`.
2.  **Discover Server Spec:** Click the "Discover & Generate Mock A2A Server Spec (JSON)" button. This will populate the textarea with a JSON specification describing the embedded mock A2A server.
3.  **Select a Threat:** Choose a threat category from the list on the left.
4.  **Run Test:** Click "Run Test" on the selected category card.
5.  **View Results:** The AI will perform its assessment. View the generated "Vulnerability Report" and "Interaction Log" in the right-hand panel.

## 5. Acknowledgements and Inspiration

This project is inspired by the **Agentic AI Red Teaming guide**, a joint effort by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and OWASP AI Exchange, led by Ken Huang. Their work provided the foundational understanding and taxonomy of threats explored in this tool.
